        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Ayaan, and I’m a student with a strong passion for learning, exploring, and pushing my limits—both mentally and physically. I’ve always had a natural curiosity about how things work, which drives me to constantly read and gather information on a wide range of topics. Whether it’s science, technology, current events, or random facts, I enjoy diving deep into knowledge and applying it creatively to my personal projects. I’m the kind of person who likes to connect ideas and turn them into something practical or interesting. Alongside academics, I’m also physically gifted—I can run very fast and excel in almost every sport I try. Whether it’s on the track, the field, or the court, I bring energy, speed, and a competitive spirit. Sports have taught me discipline, focus, and the importance of teamwork, which I carry into all areas of my life. I take pride in balancing both my intellectual and physical strengths. I enjoy challenging myself and learning from every experience. I believe growth happens when you step outside your comfort zone, and I try to do that as often as I can. I’m constantly working on projects that reflect who I am and what I’m passionate about. This website is one of those projects—a place where I can share my journey, my thoughts, and my ideas. It’s a snapshot of who I am, what I love, and where I’m heading. Thanks for visiting and getting to know a bit about me.</p>
